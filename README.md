# Gazebo-World
A world for my robot created using Gazebo simulator
Gazebo Simulator helps us to build a environment for our robot in order to test their working and functionality. 
Gazebo simulator mainly consists of a model editor and a building editor both used for constructing an testing environment for the robot.
Building editor mainly helps to add features to the Gazebo world such as walls, windows, doors etc. These features are mainly present in build folder.
Model editor is used for robot designing and also used for creating obstacles to the robot. The model folder mainly consists of bulding and robot's  model details.
Lastly the world folder consists of all the plugins of robot, building and models which is used to launch it in the gazebo environment.
